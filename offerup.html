				<h2>Redesigning the entire shopping experience</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				During my summer at OfferUp, I redesigned one of the most important sections of the app, end-to-end. OfferUp is currently transitioning a design refresh, and I joined the UX team right at the start of it all. I was encouraged to dive deep with blue-sky, open design thinking and to repetitively research, design, and test new components.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the help of Research and Product teams, my manager and I were responsible for evolving the new shopping experience. <b>Browse</b> and <b>Search</b> flows are fundamental to any shopping routine, and ultimately what drive users to our app and keep them engaged. As the designs I worked on won't be launched until Q2-Q3 of 2020, I can't disclose any specific details of my project, but I can say that:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I created new components that drive user engagement, in the <b>search</b>, <b>browse</b>, and <b>item detail</b> flows.
					</li>
					<li>
						I researched and <b>rapid prototyped</b> usability-tested flows every day. Most mornings I would review new remote usability tests (administered using UserTesting.com) and compared notes with my researcher on specific iterations of my screens, to redesign them again and dispatch new prototypes for the next round of testing.
					</li>
					<li>
						I worked very closely with Research and Product, meeting to discuss both stakeholder and design requirements before usability testing my new designs. I negotiated sizing and functionality of home screen components with Product, as we determined what would be most valuable to our customers.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>

				Towards the tail end of my internship, I was preparing to present all of the work I had done over the past 12 weeks in our company-wide All-Hands Meeting. Rather than presenting static .png images of my frames, I chose to animate all my work using Facebook's Origami Studio. Learning the design tool also helped tremendously when presenting to Product and Exec teams certain scroll-away behaviors and how elements should collapse on a page.

				<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				During this internship, I grew my design thinking more than any other project I've had before. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from my time at OfferUp is to <b>design wide</b>, as much and as often as possible. Not often does an entire experience of an app need to be redesigned, so when handed a deliverable this significant, <b>every and all</b> ideas should be considered, even the crazy ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to working here, I tended to design maybe two to three alterations of a flow I had in mind before seeking critique. I quickly learned here that I should be experimenting with five or more, as each design can host something valuable. During our weekly UX team crits, I would present whatever I had been working on over the past few days, and felt that while my designs and their alternates were unique, they could support even more variability, no matter how small. Many times a feature from one my least favorite wireframes ended up being picked up by Product, tested well, and incorporated in the refresh.

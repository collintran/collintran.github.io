				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Nexsan 7</b> is a car infotainment operating system, featuring modern media features not competently integrated (or too complex to use) in even some of today's brand new cars. Using a Google Nexus 7 and a custom launcher from the Play Store, I created an <b>interactive</b> and <b>customizable</b> driver interface. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This started as a passion project for my 2007 Nissan 350Z, a fantastic sports car that unfortunately severely lacks in the infotainment department.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2007, Nissan shipped their flagship sports car with nothing more advanced than a 6-disc changer. Unfortunately, the current aftermarket (Kenwood, JVC, Pioneer) solutions aren't that great either. I decided to give the 350Z's media UX a refresh.
			</p>

				<h2>Project details</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Role</b>: UI and hardware design
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Date</b>: Summer 2017
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Duration</b>: 6 weeks
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Team size</b>: 1
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I designed the new UI and engineered how the tablet would be housed and integrated with the 350Z's electrical system. This car has since sold, for a <b>37% increase</b> from purchase price! I'd like to think Nexsan 7 had a large contributing factor in that.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				I got the car <b>nine</b> years after many, many users shared their disappointment in Nissan’s attempt at an infotainment system, specifically in the designated 350z owners forums. I conducted a group survey within these forums and discussed complaints and design flaws amongst 350z enthusiasts. As a new owner to this car, I quickly empathized with the other enthusiasts on the forum and agreed with the majority of their complaints.

					<p>
						<h5>Key takeaways</h5>
					</p>
					<p>
						From my case study surveying the enthusiasts of my350z and 350ztech forums, I concluded that the following features should be prioritized in my Nexus integration:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Users are willing to invest thousands of dollars in the car's media system (head unit, speakers, navigation, etc.) as they spend so much time interacting with it every time they drive
								<ul>
									<li>
										The fact that all of these systems have to be separate is extremely inconvenient
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Smartphone interactivity is a priority  when choosing aftermarket solutions, so users may access navigation or their music library
							</li>
							<li>
								As sports car owners, enthusiasts constantly monitor engine health through external OBD2 boxes and companion apps
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						I also noted all of the more nuanced technical features users wanted to see in a new head unit, as shown in my field notes.

				<h5>Significance</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				My audit of <i>My350z</i> and <i>350ztech</i> enthusiast forums helped me create user personas to better understand specific pain points.

				<h5>Design requirements</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I then created requirements that my new OS could support, considering the hardware constraints as well:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Retain OEM styling to enforce premium feeling</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						Access Bluetooth connectivity settings quickly
					</li>
					<li>
						Simplify dashboard to quick-access, driver-specific actions
					</li>
					<li>
						Give users autonomy to customize dashboard
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Given our design requirements, I conducted a competitive analysis of how other device companies may have addressed usability, safety, and accessibility concerns with their interfaces. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The main sources of inspiration I found were Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which were in their very early stages of development in 2016.
			</p>

					<img src="img/nexsan7/androidauto.jpg">
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<p>
				I found that both interfaces had extremely limited input, probably for safety reasons, not giving drivers any reason to not be watching the road. While CarPlay's app-grid system or Android Auto's stacked card layout remained simple and nearly identical to their mobile counterparts, I felt that copying a simple layout would feel too reminiscent of any other phone OS, and I needed to design something more specialized to the 350Z.

				<h2>
					Design
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>
					Low-fidelity
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I sketched and annotated designs that I could quickly mock up to the 7" tablet, and ensure that simplicity and safety were at the forefront of all design decisions.

				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Before actually disassembling the 350z’s interior and removing the head unit, I drafted preliminary sketches of how my solution would be implemented; how it would fit with the rest of the interior.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>
					High-fidelity
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				After finalizing what my interface on the tablet would look like, I created high-fidelity wireframes on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
			</p>
			<p>

						<figcaption>(excuse the GameBoy tab, I wanted to experiment with "passenger entertainment")</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				While finalizing my high-fidelity frames, I realized that I needed retain the OEM styling. I made the following changes to tie the UX together:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Leather texture pack as dashboard background to match dashboard of car
					</li>
					<li>
						Brushed aluminum texture pack on app drawer dividers to match interior furniture and accents
					</li>
					<li>
						Orange "stitching" to match seat and upholstery of car
					</li>
					<li>
						"Z" logo, for the heritage and brand recognition
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>
					Prototyping
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>
					Software
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that the designs were done, they needed to be functional.
			</p>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-9">
					<p>
						I approached the technical implementation of Nexsan 7 using Nova Launcher, the most popular launcher in the Google Play Store. Nova gives users endless customization control when adding widgets and defining gestures to stack features, which is exactly what I needed to support my design.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, simply installing a custom launcher on a tablet and hooking it up to  accessory power isn’t sufficient enough for full usability. The tablet needs to stay on while the vehicle is on, but fully turn off (not standby) when the ignition is shut off. Stock Android and Nova Launcher do not allow you to control this without root access to the kernel.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a complex task for what seems like such a simple operation; the flowchart below should explain the difference.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-3">
					<img src="img/nexsan7/nova.png">
				</div>
			</div>
			<img src="img/nexsan7/flowchart.png">
			<p>
				Once granted Superuser access, the state of the tablet is simplified to literally an on/off switch, just like any other device in the vehicle. Special thanks to the members at xda-developers.com, who provided detailed instructions on how to “root” the Nexus 7, along with  thousands of other Android devices in their database.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="container">
			<p>
				<h5>
					Hardware
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving on to hardware. Usually my least favorite part of custom car work; removing all the panels to prepare for install and cleaning out almost a decade’s worth of human grime. However, it does segue into my favorite part, which is fabrication — cutting and forming parts that were never designed to fit and creating something useful.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is also relevant to what I mentioned with power on/off behavior. The 350Z’s wiring harness has both <i>switched</i> power and <i>constant</i> power wires used for the original (and aftermarket) head unit. This will need to be spliced into the microUSB charing port to supply switched power to the Nexus 7.
			</p>
			<p>
				<figure>
						<img src="img/nexsan7/wiring.jpg">
						<figcaption>After passing through many owners' hands and "professional" installs throughout the last decade, the wiring harness is a total mess</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now to mockup the actual Nexus 7 tablet to the center console frame. It doesn’t fit quite perfectly (as expected), so we created a secondary Plexiglass bezel to flush-mount it.

				After completing the Plexiglass frame and securing the device in place, all components were ready for installation and initial testing.

				<h2>
					Final thoughts
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I'm very pleased with the end result. Designing a car operating system forced many constraints that I don't typically consider when creating mobile experiences – safety and accessibility. Fabricating a tablet into a car's center console is a whole other story, having to physically mold the device to a (roughly) 7" cutout, and making sure all electricals function as they should. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason I took on this project in the first place was to combat the huge gap in technology available to cars, which continues to grow every year exponentially, and renders cars "outdated" and unusable. What (hopefully) makes this a timeless design, is that its based on Android, and really only limited by the apps and widgets that third-party developers are willing to create. So far, app development doesn’t look like it’ll be slowing down any time soon.

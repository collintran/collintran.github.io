				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Meal Matchup</b> is an open-source web-app that helps facilitate food recovery by streamlining the donation and logistics process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our <a href="https://www.mealmatchup.org" target="_blank">website</a> partners <b>local dining halls</b>, <b>volunteer groups</b>, and <b>non-profit organizations</b> together to facilitate the transportation of food waste. Dining halls indicate when they have excess food items (that would normally be composted) and when volunteer deliverers should pick them up for transport. Volunteers pick up the excess food and transport it to a shelter in need, or other non-profit organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Project details</h2>

							<li>
								<b>Role</b>: UX design and Video production lead

							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						I was brought on the Meal Matchup team during its second quarter, where the problem statement, initial research, and design language had been started. I focused on building out our flows on the <b>dining hall system</b>. I also documented our entire process, findings, and solution to publish our public outreach video.

				<h2>Problem</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				In the U.S. alone, 40 percent of food goes to waste. A 15 percent reduction in food waste would feed more than 25 million Americans yearly and provide meals to the 15 percent of U.S. households who are food insecure (USDA). 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, dining halls work with food delivery groups to collect leftover food from dining halls and deliver them to agencies in need. These delivery groups, however, have limited transportation and service resources, and need additional support. Lack of these resouces results in hundreds of pounds of food composted every week.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="img/mealmatchup/problem.png">
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				We defined three primary stakeholders: <b>dining halls</b>, <b>volunteer groups</b>, and <b>shelters</b> (or other nonprofits). Therefore, Meal Matchup needed to build three different interfaces for each member in this network. I focused on researching and designing for the dining hall system.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Interviews</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I conducted multiple in-person interviews with three managers from the largest dining halls at the UW, in addition to my team's phone interviews with employees across 50 local shelters and 6 food banks. We asked these participants about their past and existing food recovery efforts, constraints, pain points, and what online web or app tools they may have used.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				After learning what tools dining hall managers use currently to help displace some of their waste, I conducted competitive analyses of food recovery sites, including ReFed, MealConnect, Food Recovery Network, and Feeding America.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h5>Contextual inquiry</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked closely with Andrea Benson, the manager at UW's Local Point dining hall. I was able to interview her about Local Point's current food recovery efforts as she walked me through her normal workflow.
			</p>

				<h5>Key takeaways</h5>
			</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>
						From my case study surveying the enthusiasts of my350z and 350ztech forums, I concluded that the following features should be prioritized in my Nexus integration:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Food transportatoin is the <b>largest pain point</b> in the food recovery process
								<ul>
									<li>
										Current food recovery systems are too complex to use or require extra work
									</li>
									<li>
										There is currently no "one" system or rules in place for food recovery
									</li>
									<li>
										Shelters lack resources to pick up donations, when they do become available
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Most food recovery groups are stretched to capacity
							</li>
							<li>
								Dining hall lose interest in food recovery apps because they took too long to find deliverers and/or enter food items available
							</li>
						</ul>

		<div class="container">
			<p>
				<h5>Design requirements</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				After compiling our research from all three stakeholders together, we finalized design requirements for our system:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Build edge case of <b>emergency</b> deliveries, that don't rely on volunteers
					</li>
					<li>
						Give all stakeholders a visualization of all past, current, and future deliveries
					</li>
					<li>
						Require synchronization of all three parties to request and approve of deliveries
					</li>
					<li>
						Streamline process of food item detail entry
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Information architecture</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I broke down the complex process into an information architecture, and started ideating on the donating agency portion (blue icons).
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="img/mealmatchup/flow.png">

		<div class="container">
			<p>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
			</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>
						We began breaking down each stakeholder group and comparing overlaps in our information architecture, and began determining what operations each user needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before designing, we determined <b>evaluation criteria</b>, in which we would measure how successful our interface was in food delivery.
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Number of successful vs. failed deliveries
							</li>
							<li>
								Number of pounds of diverted food from compost to shelter meals
							</li>
							<li>
								Satisfaction, happiness and/or fulfillment of all participating groups
							</li>
						</ul>

				<h5>
					Interactive calendar
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				We determined that the best tool powerful enough to manage various recurring and emergency food pickup requests would be an interactive calendar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar to adding and categorizing events to a regular calendar, the Meal Matchup network calendar would detail:
				<ul>
					<li>
						food delivery information
					</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								who is picking up and when
							</li>
							<li>
								what food items are ready for pickup and how much they weigh
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>
						editing existing items or adding more
					</li>
					<li>
						any additional points of contact
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				I worked on the primary calendar UI and event cards.

					<p>
						After we pushed our low-fidelity screens to Figma, we were ready to start prototype testing. We split into smaller teams, testing our prototypes with all three stakeholders using Figma Mirror.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our participants stepped through a fully-functional prototype and were tasked with:
						<ul>
							<li>
								editing food item quantities and weights for pickup
							</li>
							<li>
								scheduling new recurring pickup requests
							</li>
							<li>
								scheduling <b>emergency</b> pickup requests
							</li>

								adding new primary contacts of pickup

			<p>
				<h5>
					Usability test findings and iterations
				</h5>
			</p>

			<p>
				After administering usability tests with 5 different dining hall staff, our key findings were:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Calendar items and notifications need to standout and/or pop out
					</li>
					<li>
						More information is needed for dining halls to keep track of food donations (add fields for food items, more specific pickup logistic fields)
					</li>
					<li>
						Do not require groups to be chosen when requesting pickups (first-claim system)
					</li>
					<li>
						Allow text/email notifications
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
			<h5>
				Calendar dashboard
			</h5>
			<br>

				After multiple rounds of usability testing, I finalized modules for our new scheduling and editing cards.

				<h2>
					Final thoughts
				</h2>
			</p>

			<p>
				This project was the first time I've worked on a team this large, negotiating designs with 10+ people at once, and sometimes seemed overwhelming. This was also the first time I had to consider three stakeholders at one time and navigate how all three overlap with each other, but at the same time sticking to my two user flows, focusing solely on the dining hall managers. I felt that a lot of time was spent negotiating what would be best for our stakeholders, rather than moving forward to real design, which sometimes created friction between team members. I learned that sometimes as designers we just need to step back from the details, get out of the weeds, and look at all of our decisions at a high level – everything else should come secondary, and the users will benefit the most in the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the end I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to work on a campus-funded program that directly reduces UW's carbon footprint and waste contribution. I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to research, design, and prototype with. Look out for Meal Matchup rolling out late 2020!

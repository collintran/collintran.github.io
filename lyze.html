				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Lyze</b> is a smart breathalyzer and mobile app that measures blood alcohol content (BAC) levels, and suggests relevant courses of action to ensure personal safety. Lyze provides both casual and frequent alcohol consumers BAC monitoring and visualization. With Lyze, users can ensure that they (or their peers) never reach critical BAC levels, and if they do, how to respond safely.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Project details</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Role</b>: Product design
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Date</b>: March 2019
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Duration</b>: 4 weeks
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Team size</b>: 2 members
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				My partner and I designed and tested Lyze. I focused on prototyping our physical breathalyzers and redesigning the app in <b>night mode</b>.
			</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
			</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>
						At our meeting the next day, we wanted to determine whether the BAC-reading technology was advanced enough to make a sub-compact breathalyzer, and stumbled across existing devices, like the BACtrack S80.
					</p>
					<p>
						The majority of the bulk of the S80 is that it serves to be a standalone device, with various breathalyzer modes and a display screen, rather than pair the unit with a smartphone.
					</p>
					<p>
						We conducted audits of other portable breathalyzers to identify technological constraints, market demand, and how they paired with smartphones or not. We compared app experiences of the DrinkMate and AlcoMate AL7000 devices.
					</p>

			<p>
				<h5>Interviews</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				We identified potential users through social networks, and interviewed four individuals, ages 20-22. We inquired our participants about their alcohol consumption; how they monitor their drunknness, whether they would be interested in learning more about their current drunk state, and how likely they would be to carry a breathalyzer on their person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our second primary user group were recovering alcoholics, or individuals who consume alcohol frequently, and would like to better monitor their health. As we were unable to source alcoholics on such a short timeline, we researched the <b>r/alcoholism</b> Reddit forum, searching specifically for breathalyzer use.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Key takeaways</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In addition to knowing what BAC they are at currently, then want to know when they'll be sober
					</li>
					<li>
						Users would like a visualization of their BAC through out the night and throughout the month, which would support their decision to continue drinking in the future, or cut back
					</li>
					<li>
						Users would like to know <b>legal limitations</b> of what they can and cannot do at their current states.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Personas</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Insights from our user interviews and audit helped us create user personas and map their pain points and goals.

				<h5>Design requirements</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I identified requirements that our solution should address:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Breathalyzer unit should have one affordance; to take BAC measurement, and no other additional complexity
					</li>
					<li>
						Provide users quick actions relevant to their current BACs and inform them of their legal limitations
					</li>
					<li>
						Visualize historical BAC 
					</li>
					<li>
						Inform users of estimated sobriety and remind them to continue recording their BACs
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<p>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
			</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>
						Given our design requirements, I sketched user scenarios of how they might interact with breathalyzers that are currently on the market, and adding a mobile app interface component that Lyze would support.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>
							Information architecture
						</h5>
					</p>
					<p>
						From design requirements we identified how the Lyze app and breathalyzer would work together, and broke down an overall information architecture of each flow before we began paper prototyping.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>
							Dynamic call to action buttons
						</h5>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Dynamic CTA</i>s change depending on what current BAC a user registers. The most requested CTAs that participants noted in our interviews were:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Call a ride home with Uber/Lyft
							</li> 
							<li>
								Ping location to emergency contacts
							</li>
							<li>
								"What does my BAC mean right now?""
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

		<div class="container">
			<p>
				<h5>
					Paper prototyping and testing
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				To prototype our breathalyzer unit, we used cardboard cut to a 4.5" x 1.0" x 0.5" rectangular prism. We also added colored paper squares as LED indicators.
			</p>


			<p>
				We decided to implement a notification system as well, reminding users to breathalyze throughout the night to best track their BAC levels. Those statistics would be viewable to the user and best judge when they should be sober. For the breathalyzer, we took inspiration from the Juul e-cigarette, as we see so popularly used. Juul’s have been marketed with an exclusive “cool-factor” that makes them increasingly attractive to youth.

			</div>

			<p>
				<h5>
					Low-fidelity
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving our paper prototypes to low-fidelity mock ups, we experimented with the hierarchy of information presented on each screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had to consider: in a drunken state, how should information be presented that is easiest to understand?
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="img/lyze/lofi.png">
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>
					Mid-fidelity
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				After multiple rounds of usability testing and critique, we created higher-fidelity screens of key screens. In this iteration we introduced color, and how we might direct attention to our call to action buttons or important information, like current BAC.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="img/lyze/midfi.png">
			</p>
			<p>
				During this stage in the design process, I upgraded the breathalyzer unit. I modeled the redesigned device in Rhino and 3D printed the new prototype.

				<h2>
					Final design

			</p>
			<p>
				"Wait, people drink <b>at night</b>."
			</p>
			<p>
				The final app solves this very obvious oversight.

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Home</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Draws attention directly to user's current BAC, what level of danger they may be in, and relevant actionables.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Analytics</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Tracks user's BAC throughout the entire night and estimates when they'll so sober. Also shows historical data from prior months and makes estimations on resultant health implications.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Effects</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Details both legal and behavioral limitations of a user's current BAC, and how they may change if the user continues drinking, or sobers up.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Friends nearby</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Track nearby friends using Lyze to make sure they get home safe. Some users don't want to share their location <i>all</i> the time, but can do so explicitly in Lyze, and determine which one of their friends can view.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Party</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For group outings, make sure that everyone is within a safe limit at-a-glance. Friends can record BAC into any group member's Lyze and direct it to the correct profile. 
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p> 
				<h2>
					Final thoughts
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Lyze showed me just how difficult user testing a health app could be, when feedback is most meaningful when participants are engaging in <i>unhealthy</i> activities. The ethical dilemma of testing <b>drunk</b> participants was far beyond the scope of this short project, but I am confident that our feedback and test results would have had more variation.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project also showed me how much complexity can be removed from every day technologies, and that not every single utility needs a screen when it can simply leverage the one we all carry in our pocket.

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Cabin</b> is a communication tool that helps connect truck drivers (and other abroad workers) to their long-distance families. Cabin is a scaled down, replica model dashboard ornament of a user's own home, that reacts to its actual changes – which rooms' lights are on, when the garage opens, or when the backdoor is open to let the dog out.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Project details</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Role</b>: Product design
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Date</b>: Spring 2019
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Duration</b>: 10 weeks
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Team size</b>: 4 members
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I worked with three other students throughout this 10-week project. As the only designer on this team, I created prototypes through each stage of the design process.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				For this purpose of this class and constraints of this project, we used interviews and directed storytelling. We found this method the most meaningful and feasible to execute due to its accessibility to willing participants, and acquire substantial research findings. We interviewed three truck drivers, who we found through Reddit AMA threads:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>P1</b> - 23 yo, female, 2 years of driving experience. P1 described the effects of her career on her social and family life and calls the driving career a “social life killer”
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>P2</b> - 48 yo, Male, 22 years of driving experience. P2 is married with children and is a owner-operator, which allows him more flexibility in his schedule and the ability to rent out his truck for additional income.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>P3</b> - 35 yo, Male, 8 years of driving experience. P3 is divorced without children, and acknowledges his job was a factor in his divorce. He believes the trucking industry is impractical for the “family man” and embraces “impermanent relationships”.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<h5>Key takeaways</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Erratic time schedules and constantly crossing time zones makes it difficult for truckers to communicate back home when they're available to talk
					</li>
					<li>
						Extreme loneliness, feeling like they are truly alone by themselves, 24/7
					</li>
					<li>
						Sense of missing out on smaller details of family life; when they have dinner, when kids are studying, when they come home from school
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h5>Significance</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				After conducting interviews and directed storytelling sessions with our participants, we created personas that encapsulated the archetypes for our trucker user group.

				<h5>Design requirements</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				I identified requirements that should be addressed:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Passive communication tool that requires little to no input
					</li>
					<li>
						Dynamic, reactive tool that enforces feeling of being "home"
					</li>
					<li>
						No reliance on separate device
					</li>
					<li>
						Portable and disassemblable for easy transport
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Given our design requirements, my team and I brainstormed potential user scenarios to guide our ideation process. Then translated them to higher fidelity picture storyboards.

				<h5>
					Proposal
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Given our design requirements derived from our personas and user research, and the nature of truck driving, we determined that we could solve their pain points best with a familiar device, a dashboard ornament. Truckers already decorate their dashes with toys and trinkets that remind them of home, so we are providing them with a replica model of their home that was reactive to the actual state of their home.
			</p>

			<p>
				<h5>
					Paper prototyping
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily, we found one local truck driver with a schedule free enough to donate 45 minutes of their time to help us test a prototype, which we created with paper cut outs and battery-powered LED candles.

				<h5>
					3D modeling and printing
				</h5>
			</p>

			<p>
				After several rounds of critique in our design studios, I started modeling what a potential house model could look like, using Rhino.
			</p>
			<p>
				The house is bit modular for convenient transport, as truckers switch their semi-trucks quite often.

			<p>
				<h2>
					Final design
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				For the final dashboard ornament design, and all measurements fully dialed in, the model was ready to accept the reactive LEDs. For proof of concept, I have demo'd how the LEDs may switch colors using an Arduino board. The switching colors represent a certain family member's availability.

				<h5>
					Features
				</h5>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Doorknock</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Drivers can push on their home model's door to "knock" on the house back home, which sends an SMS text to members of the household, letting them know that he/she is available to call
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Live lighting</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Feel at home knowing when family members are in their rooms studying, coming together for dinner, or sleeping through the night
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Two-way passive calling</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Members of household can set their availability through their light switch at home, which will change the lighting of their room so that drivers know whether they can call or not
								<ul>
									<li>
										Yellow signifies available, magenta signifies busy
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

				<h2>
					Final thoughts
				</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				Cabin was the first project I designed for without using any screens or mobile app. Constraining my design thinking to not include an app was definitely a challenge, as I'm forced to work within the confines of essentially a toy house. In the context of bridging long-distance families together though, I now feel like the absence of screen technology is <i>more</i> meaningful than what can be created throurgh an app, or even a video call.
			</p>
			<p>
				I experienced how frustrating finding representative from such a niche user group was in this project, as none of the people in our extended networks could reach more than one actual truck driver, which made usability testing our prototypes for sizing and features astronomically more difficult.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also wanted to explore a model <b>truck</b> for the family's end. If the trucker receives a model house that's reactive to his/her home, the family should receive a reactive model of their truck driver's truck. We were actually halfway through design and prototyping of this concept, but were too time-constrained to sufficiently test and develop it further.
